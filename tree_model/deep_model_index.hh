/* Converts a non-persitent QModelIndex into a persistent one.

Main difference to [QPersistentModelIndex][qpers] is that
Deep_Model_Index also allows for referenced elements being
temporarily removed. When structure changing operations after
and including the removal are rolled back, the Deep_Model_Index
is still valid.

Also it does not connects to any signals of the model
referenced by the [QModelIndex][qmodi].
